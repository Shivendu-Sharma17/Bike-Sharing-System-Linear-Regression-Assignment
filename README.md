# Bike Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
A US bike-sharing provider BikeIndia has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
Business Goal: We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

* [Conclusions]-As per the final Model 6, the top 3 predictor variables that influence the bike rental bookings are:

Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.5636’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire stats by 0.5636 units.
Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.3070’ indicated that, w.r.t Weathersit1, a unit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire stats by 0.3070 units.
Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2308’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire stats by 0.2308 units.
    
Therefore, it's suggested to give these predictor variables the utmost importance while booking bike rentals to achieve maximum booking.
